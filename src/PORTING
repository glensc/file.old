Portability of the new file(1) command.

Obviously if you are running the old Ritchie compiler or
something else that doesn't know about void, you will have
to un-comment-out the definition of `void=int' in the Makefile.

I had hoped to be able to make a file command that
didn't have any system-dependant #ifdefs, no special libraries,
etc., etc. Well, System V shot me down. They moved the definition
of major() and minor() out of <sys/types.h> into <sys/sysmacros.h>.
So, if major isn't defined after including types.h, I automatically
include sys/sysmacros.h. If you have a system in which neither
types.h nor sysmacros.h defines `major', you will get a compilation
error in trying to compile a warning message. Please do the following:
	1) change the appropriate (2nd) #include at the start of 
		fsmagic.c
and	2) let me know the name of the system, the release number,
	   and the name of the header file that *does* include
	   this "standard" definition.

Other than this, there should be no portability problems,
but one never knows these days. Please let me know of any
other problems you find porting to a UNIX system. I don't much
care about non-UNIX systems but will collect magic numbers
for them.
