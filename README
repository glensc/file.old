** ALPHA TEST RELEASE **
You are getting this ahead of the rest of the world because
you need it or because I like you or something. Please do not
forward it to anybody yet. The "official" version will appear
in mod.sources at a theater or USENET site near you in time
for the Christmas rush. 

** File(1) Command **
This is Ian Darwin's (copyright but distributable unmodified)
file(1) command. It follows the USG (Sys V) model of the file
command, rather than the Research (V7) version. That is, there
is a file (/etc/magic) that contains much of the ritual information
that is the source of this program's power. It knows a little
more magic (including tar archives) than System V; the /etc/magic
parsing seems to be compatible with the (poorly documented)
System V /etc/magic format. 

In addition, the /etc/magic file is built from a subdirectory
for easier maintenance. At the instigation of John Gilmore,
I will act as a clearinghouse for magic numbers assigned to
all sorts of whacko data files that are in reasonable circulation.
Send your whacko magic numbers, in file(5) format please(!), to the 
address above.
