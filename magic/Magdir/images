# Old pbm format (most didn't have real magic number).
0	short	0x2a17	"compact bitmap" format (Poskanzer)

# I just got pointed to your file program, with all the magic numbers.
# Neat.  I enclose a magic file for image formats.  You already have
# a better entry for Sun rasterfiles, so ignore that one.  I made this
# file by going through all the format converters in the PBMPLUS package
# and noting which ones had magic numbers.  Disappointingly few of them
# did.

# All of these entries use the "string" format so that they will work on
# both big-endian and little-endian machines.
