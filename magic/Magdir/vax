# Byte-swapped VAXen
# Here are a few lines you can add to /etc/magic on your sun workstations in
# order to recognize VAX executables and objects.... you could do something
# similar (in reverse) for your vaxen, but since 4.3+NFS' file(1) doesn't look
# for /etc/magic, I've never bothered.  It really should be built in to file(1)
# so you would see the state of setuid/setgid/sticky bits.  Or actually, there
# should be support for checking that sort of thing in /etc/magic.
