               file build and installation instructions
               ----------------------------------------

To build and install file:

[Only if you're compiling the CVS sources, first make sure you have
the GNU autotools installed (automake >= 1.8, autoconf >= 2.59) and
run

        autoreconf -i
]

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3) To install file, run

	make install

   By default, file is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/file

   You can also run it in place (src/file), but if you do that you'll
   need to give the path to the magic files explicitly.


Options
-------

For configure options, run

	./configure --help
